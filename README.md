# 🗣️ Moshi-Finetune: Fine-Tuning Moshi/J-Moshi on Your Own Spoken Dialogue Data

![Moshi-Finetune](https://img.shields.io/badge/Moshi--Finetune-Ready-brightgreen)

Welcome to the **Moshi-Finetune** repository! This project allows you to fine-tune the Moshi and J-Moshi models using your own spoken dialogue data. Fine-tuning can help improve model performance and make it more suited to your specific needs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, you need to download the latest release of the Moshi-Finetune package. You can find it [here](https://github.com/saadanibilel/moshi-finetune/releases). Download the file and follow the instructions to execute it on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

You can install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saadanibilel/moshi-finetune.git
   cd moshi-finetune
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Use pip to install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**

   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/saadanibilel/moshi-finetune/releases) section to download the latest version. After downloading, execute the file to set up the environment.

### Usage

Once you have everything set up, you can start fine-tuning your models. Here’s a simple guide on how to use the tool:

1. **Prepare Your Data**

   Ensure your spoken dialogue data is in the correct format. The expected format is a CSV file with columns for input and output dialogues.

2. **Run the Fine-Tuning Script**

   Use the following command to start fine-tuning:

   ```bash
   python finetune.py --data your_data.csv --model your_model
   ```

   Replace `your_data.csv` with the path to your data file and `your_model` with the model you want to fine-tune.

3. **Evaluate the Model**

   After fine-tuning, evaluate the model using:

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model your_model
   ```

   This will give you insights into how well the model performs on your data.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
moshi-finetune/
├── data/
│   └── your_data.csv
├── models/
│   └── your_model
├── scripts/
│   ├── finetune.py
│   └── evaluate.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

- **data/**: This folder contains your spoken dialogue data.
- **models/**: Store your fine-tuned models here.
- **scripts/**: Contains the Python scripts for fine-tuning and evaluation.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies needed for the project.

## 🔍 How It Works

Moshi and J-Moshi are advanced models designed for dialogue systems. They leverage state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing (NLP) to understand and generate human-like responses. Fine-tuning these models on your specific data allows them to adapt to your unique dialogue style and improve performance.

### Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Your data is cleaned and formatted to fit the model’s requirements.
2. **Training**: The model is trained on your data, adjusting its parameters to minimize errors.
3. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated to ensure it meets performance standards.

### Benefits of Fine-Tuning

- **Customization**: Tailor the model to your specific use case.
- **Improved Performance**: Enhance accuracy and relevance of responses.
- **Faster Response Times**: Optimize the model for quicker interactions.
